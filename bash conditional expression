       arg1 OP arg2
              OP is one of -eq, -ne, -lt, -le, -gt, or -ge.  These arithmetic binary operators return true if arg1 is equal to, not equal to, less than, less than
              or equal to, greater than, or greater than or equal to arg2, respectively.  Arg1 and arg2 may be positive or negative integers.
